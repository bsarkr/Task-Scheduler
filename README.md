#Task-Scheduler

This personal project is still a work in progress, but it will be capable of the following:

1) taking user input from a GUI
2) Scheduling tasks based on deadlines, ensuring all tasks are done before the deadline.
3) Rearranging tasks if needed for new tasks with earlier deadlines.
4) remembering previously added tasks to help with re-adding a similar task
5) give the user the ability to change "work hours,' meaning the time they are available to complete tasks
